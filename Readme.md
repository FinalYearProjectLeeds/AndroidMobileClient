## Individual Contribution
I developed a mobile application which collects data through a questionnaire targeted at detecting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in toddlers.
After users complete the questionnaire, their responses are sent to a Flask API, also available in my profile.
This API triggers an inference process within machine learning models, which predict potential ASD cases.
The predictions from the models are then relayed back to the mobile application in real-time, providing immediate feedback based on the user-provided responses.
